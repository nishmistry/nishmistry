# Hi, I'm Nish 👋🏽👨🏽‍💻
I'm an honors student at Northeastern University, studying Computer Science and Economics.

My passion lies in harnessing technology to craft innovative solutions that have a tangible impact. Whether it’s building a full-stack application to solve niche problems for my dance team, or making a journaling application for my Object-Oriented Design class, I thrive on solving challenges.

Feel free to check out my GitHub to see some of the problems that I've solved -- and some of the problems that I'm working on!
